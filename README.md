"I have a JavaScript practical.
Here is my AIM: <write your aim here>.
Give me 3 files: HTML, CSS, and JS.
Make the code medium-level (not too basic, not too advanced).
Make it look like a student wrote it, not AI.
Keep the code clean, simple, and matching the AIM only.
After the code, give me a short summary of what each file does and what concepts are used."
